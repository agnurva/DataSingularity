Data visualization refers to the techniques used to understand and communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects (e.g., points, lines or bars). It is a very important skill to possess when working with data and is an absolute must for all data analysts and data scientists. In this blog I will try and illustrate the importance of using visual objects to understand and communicate data.

## Understanding data
Consider the data given below. It consists of 4 different datasets with two variables 'x' and 'y' in each set.
Each dataset consists of 11 observations.

|   I|   |   II|   |   III|   |   IV|   |
| x  | y  | x  | y  |  x | y  | x  | y  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
10.0 |	8.04 |	10.0 |	9.14 |	10.0 |	7.46 |	8.0 |	6.58
8.0 |	6.95 |	8.0 |	8.14 |	8.0 |	6.77 |	8.0 |	5.76
13.0 |	7.58 |	13.0 |	8.74 |	13.0 |	12.74 |	8.0 |	7.71
9.0 |	8.81 |	9.0 |	8.77 |	9.0 |	7.11 |	8.0 |	8.84
11.0 |	8.33 |	11.0 |	9.26 |	11.0 |	7.81 |	8.0 |	8.47
14.0 |	9.96 |	14.0 |	8.10 |	14.0 |	8.84 |	8.0 |	7.04
6.0 |	7.24 |	6.0 |	6.13 |	6.0 |	6.08 |	8.0 |	5.25
4.0 |	4.26 |	4.0 |	3.10 |	4.0 |	5.39 |	19.0 |	12.50
12.0 |	10.84 |	12.0 |	9.13 |	12.0 |	8.15 |	8.0 |	5.56
7.0 |	4.82 |	7.0 |	7.26 |	7.0 |	6.42 |	8.0 |	7.91
5.0 |	5.68 |	5.0 |	4.74 |	5.0 |	5.73 |	8.0 |	6.89
