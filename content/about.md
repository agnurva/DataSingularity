## The website
I have always wondered why human evolution is extra oridnary compared to other living organisms. All organisms that exist today have adapted to survive in their ecosystems. One of the most important adaptation that helps in survival is the ability to gather information from the surrounding. This is achieved through the senses which are the primary input devices to the living body and acts upon these inputs to live and thrive. Some of the living organisms have optimised their sense while other have developed new. Today there are more than 20 known senses that help gather data to support life. The number of senses and the extend to which it is optimised can be used to identify the nature of a living organism. Humans have only a subset of these senses and most them are only averagely optimised, while some of the living organisms are good at processing this data much better than humans, we have a unique ability that none other possess. The ability to persist data and information across generations through non biological means. In simple terms 'written records' in the form of texts, pictures, art, music, books etc. DIGITAL CODEX is a collection of my personal records which are mostly related to data and its usage.

# Why records about DATA and its usage?
Throughout history Humans have used many different techniques to collect data, process it to generate information, share the knowledge with community members and persist for later generations to infer. However in recent years we have understood the need for a common standardised system and processes while dealing with data. It will enable all the entities in an ecosystem to communicate with each other without any loss of inforamtion, especially in human machine interaction involving large scale data. It is very important to achieve this Data Singularity while we are working towards Technological Singularity.

 Technological Singularity according to wikipedia is "A hypothesis that the invention of artificial superintelligence (ASI) will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization."
